## Best practices I pointed out throughout the code
* Be aware of what libraries are available, discuss them with the team, and use those that follow your organization's guidelines
* Use secrets to keep sensitive information out of source files
* Implementation will vary from languauge to language, but generally ensure any opened data sources are safely closed
* Employ defensive programming, for example careful conversions
* Plan out proper development and testing environments
